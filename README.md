# Yogisera-Springboot-microservices


> Who am I ??

A backend site with multiple APIs; Postman will be used to consume API;

Designed for any Yoga institutions, schools or studios that need to manage and trade their products(yoga courses in this case) online to different group of people. 
<br/><br/>

> When the project is finished, I could â€¦. 

```
- Broadcast product information for enrolled students or potential interested parties; 
- View/add/update/delete new user with different authorities and permissions; 
- View/add/update/delete new products; 
- Allow transaction record made into our system; 
- Enroll users into courses and display only to authorized user(s); 
```


> Things to scale up in the future: 
<ul>
  <li> students could leave rating after the yoga course is finished </li>
  <li> attributes like 'PRICE' and 'DISCOUNT' added. </li>
 </ul>
